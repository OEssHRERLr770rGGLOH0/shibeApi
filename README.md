# ShibeAPI

Barebones sample project demonstrating use of [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/), [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/), [Ktor](https://ktor.io/), [Kotlin Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines), as well as a 
few [Android Jetpack Libraries](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) like [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation), [View Model](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel), 
[Live Data](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding), [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding), 
all through a single-activity, MVVM architecture.  

[Shared element transitions](https://developer.android.com/guide/fragments/animate) provide visual polish to the master/detail transitions.
  
## [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/)  
  
An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.  
  
## [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/)  
  
A smart Kotlin  injection  library to keep you  focused  on your app,  not on your tools .
  
## [Ktor](https://ktor.io/)  
  
Create asynchronous client and server applications. Anything from microservices to multiplatform HTTP client apps in a simple way.

## [Kotlin Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines)

Coroutines help to manage long-running tasks that might otherwise block the main thread and cause your app to become unresponsive.
  
## [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) 
Android Jetpack's Navigation Component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer. 
  
## [View Model](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) 

The `ViewModel` class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The `ViewModel` class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.

## [Live Data](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)

`LiveData` is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services. This awareness ensures LiveData only updates app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.

## [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding)

`ViewBinding` is a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.

## [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding)

The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
